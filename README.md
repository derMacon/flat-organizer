In our flat every roommate has a specific set of chores he / she has to do. This webapp should help organize those chores. In the current version it's mainly used to implement a grocery list to which each roommate can add products. The roommate who does the grocery shopping for the flat can see to which storage room all the products should be delivered via the destination column in the tables shown below. This destination will be generated automatically by the system depending on the room location of the user putting the item in the list.
