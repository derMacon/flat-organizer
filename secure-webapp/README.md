# workshop-organizer-docker
* Webapp to manage workshops. 
* Live [Server](http://168.119.120.2:8888/workshop-organizer/)

* WIP: The screenshot is just a mockup. This project is a derivative from my other project `workshop-organizer` where I try to port the project to the docker infrastructure.

## Functionality
Users can enroll and drop out of courses. An admin can promote or create users with admin or manager permissions, only those permissions make it possible for a user to create a new course. A course consists out of an panel containing all relevant information for the course such as the title, content, calender etc.. Also it is possible for the manager of the course to create announcements which will be displayed in the browser and will also be send via email to the specified course members.
